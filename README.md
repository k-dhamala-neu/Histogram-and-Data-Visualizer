# Statistical Analysis and Histogram Generator

## Team Members

## Project Overview
A C++ application that reads numerical datasets from `.csv` or `.txt` files and performs 
statistical analysis and histogram generation. The histogram is automatically exported 
and visualized using gnuplot, with the output image saved to the `images/` folder.

## Main Functionalities
- **Dataset Loading** — Reads `.csv` or `.txt` files and stores data as (x, y) pairs
- **Statistics Calculator** — Computes mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, min, and max
- **Histogram Generator** — Generates a text-based histogram in the console
- **Histogram Export** — Exports histogram data and automatically plots it using gnuplot, saving the image to `images/histogram.png`

## System Design

## OOP Design Summary
| Class | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| `Dataset` | Loads and stores data from file as (x,y) DataPoints |
| `Histogram` | Computes bin ranges, frequencies, and exports to gnuplot |
| `Statistics` | Computes statistical measures from the dataset |

## Tools and Technologies
- C++ (C++17)
- gnuplot 6.0
- WSL Ubuntu
- VS Code

## How to Run
**Dependencies:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install gnuplot
```

**Compile:**
```bash
g++ main.cpp Dataset.cpp Histogram.cpp StatsCalc.cpp -o main
```

**Run:**
```bash
./main
```

## Test Cases
A sample test dataset is provided in the `tests/` folder to verify program functionality.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tests/test.csv` | Simple distribution dataset with 20 data points |

To run with the test dataset, update the file path in `main.cpp`:
```cpp
ds.loadFile("tests/test.csv");
```
Expected outputs and explanations for each test case are documented in `tests/README_tests.md`.

## What Has Been Implemented
- Full `Dataset` class with CSV/TXT file loading
- Full `Statistics` class with all statistical computations
- Full `Histogram` class with text-based display and gnuplot export
- Automatic gnuplot visualization saved to `images/histogram.png`

## Project Goals
- Provide a simple tool for analyzing time-series or waveform datasets
- Display statistical summaries clearly in the console
- Generate publication-quality histogram images automatically

## AI Usage
This project utilized AI assistance (Claude by Anthropic) in the following ways:

- **Debugging** — Identifying and resolving runtime errors and logical bugs in C++ code
- **Concept Explanation** — Clarifying C++ concepts outside of course material such as 
   structs, advanced file I/O, and gnuplot integration
- **Documentation Formatting** — Assistance with LaTeX formatting for pseudocode and 
  system design documents, and structuring the README

All core logic, design decisions, and implementation were completed by the team. 
AI was not used to write functional code directly.
